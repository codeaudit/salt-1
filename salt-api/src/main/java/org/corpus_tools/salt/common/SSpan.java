/**
 * A span is used to group a couple of tokens together to give them exactly the
 * same annotation or to connect them as a bunch with a 3rd node at once. A span
 * therefore has the semantic of an ordered set. In a graph-based world, we need
 * to model such an ordered set as nodes and edges. Therefore Salt provides the
 * node type SSpan and the relation type SSpanningRelation. A SSpan object
 * represents the span itself and for instance could be annotated or linked with
 * other nodes. To mark a token as being part of the set, a
 * {@link SSpanningRelation} object connects each token with the span. A
 * {@link SSpanningRelation} always has a span as source and a token as target.
