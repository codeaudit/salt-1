/**
 * In Salt a document is represented by this class. An object of this class can
 * contain an object of type {@link SDocumentGraph} which contains the 'real'
 * linguistic data. An object of type {@link SDocumentGraph} can be set and get
 * by calling {@link SDocument#setDocumentGraph(SDocumentGraph)} and
 * {@link SDocument#getDocumentGraph()}. A closer documentation of a document
 * graph, you can find in {@link SDocumentGraph}. A document must always be
 * contained in a corpus (object of type {@link SCorpus}). Such a containment
 * relation in Salt is represented by an object of type {@link SCorpusRelation}.
 * How to add a {@link SDocument} object to a {@link SCorpusGraph} object please
 * see the documentation of {@link SCorpusGraph}.
 * <p>
 * A document passes it's id to a document graph, when one is set.
 * </p>
