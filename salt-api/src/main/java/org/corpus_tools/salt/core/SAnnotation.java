/**
 * <p>
 * An annotation in Salt is an attribute-value-pair and can belong to either a
 * node, an edge, a graph, a layer or another label. An attribute-value-pair is
 * a triple which consists of a namespace, a name and a value
 * (namespace:name=value). The combination of name and namespace is used to
 * identify a label and therefore must be unique. The namespace is an optional
 * value, to distinguish in case of there are two annotations having the same
 * name. For instance a node etc. can have a label stts:pos=VVFIN as well as the
 * label pos:VV to annotate it with two part-of-speech annotations from
 * different tagsets.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * SFeature objects are used to store structural information of Salt, which are
 * necessary to map a linguistic model to a graph. For instance {@link SFeature}
 * added to the relation between a token and a primary text contain the start
 * and end position of the token in the primary text. In the very most cases a
 * user of the Salt api will never need to use a {@link SFeature} object.
 * </p>
 * For further information on labels,
