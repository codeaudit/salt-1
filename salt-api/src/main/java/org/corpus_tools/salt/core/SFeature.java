/**
 * <p>
 * An object of class {@link SFeature} is a label and can be added like every
 * other label to a node, relation, graph, layer or to another label. Like every
 * label a {@link SFeature} object consists of the main fields
 * {@link Label#getNamespace()}, {@link Label#getName()} and
 * {@link Label#getValue()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link SFeature} could be used, to add some information to any Salt object
 * during a processing. So for instance you can store any state like 'already
 * processed' or other non-linguistic and non meta annotations like 'having the
 * color red' to it.
 * </p>
 * For further information on labels,
 * 
 * @see Label
