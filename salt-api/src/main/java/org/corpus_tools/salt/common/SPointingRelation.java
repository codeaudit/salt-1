/**
 * Sometimes in linguistics you want to set nodes into a relationship without
 * adding a set semantic or a hierarchical relation. You sometimes just need an
 * interlinking mechanism. Such a relation is the type {@link SPointingRelation}
 * . A pointing relation in Salt allows to relate any kind of nodes with each
 * other. In general, this type of relation has no semantics and could be used
 * for a wide range of annotations, which does not group or structure nodes. For
 * instance, this could be very helpful for a dependency analysis or
 * coreferential chains etc. . To give an example, imagine the text:
 * <p>
 * <i> 'John was a big man ... he always had to move his head' </i>
 * </p>
 * In this text 'John' (token t1) and 'he' (token ti) refer to the same entity.
 * To express that in Salt, you can create a {@link SPointingRelation} object
 * having the source t1 and the target ti , or the other way around. Now let's
 * extend this example and imagine the text 'John Doe ... he', with the tokens
 * t1 ('John'), t2 ('Doe') and ti ('he'). In this case, we want to set 'John
 * Doe' as a whole in relation to 'he'. This is possible by creating a
 * {@link SSpan} object s 1 containing t1 and t2 and relating the token t i via
 * a {@link SPointingRelation} object to s1 . To determine a
 * {@link SPointingRelation} being a coreferential relation or a dependency, you
 * should use the type attribute which is available for every {@link SRelation}.
 * Like all the other relations, {@link SPointingRelation} can be annotated to
 * express some linguistic semantics.
