/**
 * Hierarchies are a useful mechanism to express tree-like or hierarchical
 * structures behind a text. For instance, a widely used mechanism to describe
 * phrase structures are syntax trees. The term syntax trees implies that these
 * hierarchies are trees, even in a graph sense. This means, they consist of
 * nodes and relations and are therefore easy to model in Salt. Salt offers a
 * specific type of node, the {@link SStructure}, and a specific type of
 * relation, the {@link SDominanceRelation}. The source of an
 * {@link SDominanceRelation} could be a {@link SToken}, {@link SSpan} or even a
 * {@link SStructure}. The unit of both elements enables to create unbound
 * hierarchies above a tokenization.
