/**
 * <p>
 * An object of class {@link SProcessingAnnotation} is a label and can be added
 * like every other label to a node, relation, graph, layer or to another label.
 * Like every label a {@link SProcessingAnnotation} object consists of the main
 * fields {@link Label#getNamespace()}, {@link Label#getName()} and
 * {@link Label#getValue()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * SFeature objects are used to store structural information of Salt, which are
 * necessary to map a linguistic model to a graph. For instance {@link SFeature}
 * added to the relation between a token and a primary text contain the start
 * and end position of the token in the primary text. In the very most cases a
 * user of the Salt api will never need to use a {@link SFeature} object.<br/>
 * For further information on labels,
